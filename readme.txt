Speeds up websites that use Contact Form 7 Recaptcha V3. Built by Kreativo Pro WordPress Speed Specialists.

== Description ==

We at <a href="https://www.kreativopro.com/">Kreativo Pro</a> specialize in speeding up WordPress websites. But in 2019 we ran into a new challenge when Contact Form 7 started using Recaptcha V3 and Recaptcha started slowing down our client sites.

= Why to Google Recaptcha? =

There are automated bots that scrape sites from Google, find Contact Form 7 forms and submit them with spam data for promotions.

An average site gets 5+ SPAM submissions per day. This is confusing and frustrating for most website owners. Reading SPAM submissions also wastes your time.

= Why this plugin? =

A lot of Our customers wanted to use Contact Form 7 Recaptcha V3 and still wanted a very fast website. This is when our team got together one Sunday to discuss a possible solution and we found a great idea.

This plugin is a result of that idea. For more than a year, we kept this plugin within our own company and used only for our own customers. But we realized that we could help a lot more WordPress users by just realising it publicly.

And giving back to WordPress community has always been our  objective. So, here we present you our secret idea :)

If you want to use Contact Form 7 Recaptcha V3 and still want a very fast WordPress website, then just use this plugin.

= How KP Fastest Contact Form 7 Recaptcha V3 compares with other Recaptcha plugins? =

There is a plugin that converts Recaptcha V3 into Recaptcha V2 in Contact Form 7. It's great but it lacks the speed angle with V3 that we are hitting with our plugin.

Ultimately, as a website owner, you want Fast website with no SPAM. Contact Form 7 recommends Recaptcha V3. So with our plugin we have tried to keep Recaptcha V3 and also speed up your website.

You can use our plugin and check your website speed using GTMetrix or Pingdom or Google Pagespeed Insights. The speed (load time) and scores with our plugin are higher.

The great thing is that our codes can be combined and minified by Popular caching plugins like WP Fastest Cache, Autoptimze, WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, Swift Performance etc.
